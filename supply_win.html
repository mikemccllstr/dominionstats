    <p>This contains an interface to card winning stats that depend
    on having up to two other cards available in the supply.  It also 
    ranks cards and determines how much a cards quality changes as
    a function of having other cards available.

    <div style="float:left;width:45%;margin:10px">
      <h3>Interpretting the stats</h3>

      <p>This let's you see how cards perform when others are available to
        be gained.  When a card is conditioned upon, it simply restricts
        the statistics to games in which that card was available in the 
        supply.  The conditioned upon card does not ever have to be gained.

    <ul>
      <li><b>Availability</b>:  The number of games in which the card is 
        present, multiplied by the number of players in each game. 
        It represents the number of "decks" that could have purchased 
        that card.
      <li><b>%+</b>: Percentage of times the named card was gained at 
        least once.
      <li><b>Per Gain</b>: This is win rate on the card on a per gain basis.
        If player 1 bought the card 5 times and won, and player 2 bought the 
        card 3 times and lost, then this would count as 5 wins and 3 losses
        in two player games, giving a win rate of 5 * 2 / (5 + 3) =
        10 / 8 = 1.25.  
      <li><b>Any Gain</b>: This is a win rate that does not include multiple
        gains of a card in the same game.  In the above 5 winning vs 3 losing
        example, the card would have a win rate of 1, because both players
        purchased it.
      <li><b>Num Gained</b>: The average number of the times the card was
        gained when it was available, per player.
      <li><b>Quality</b>: This is a measure of card quality that tries to
        recover the excellent 
        <a href="http://forum.dominionstrategy.com/index.php?topic=1134.0">
        community card rankings</a> using only the statistics about the 
        cards and information about the cards themselves.  Currently
        <a href="https://github.com/rrenaud/dominionstats/blob/master/card_ranker/optimize_ranks.py">the ranking function</a> 
        recovers almost 90% of the community ordered pairs, 
        using only the following signals:
        <ul>
          <li>the win rate given any gain
          <li>the chance of a card being gained
          <li>the number plus actions
          <li>whether it has vp
          <li>whether it's a reaction
        </ul>
      <li><b>&Delta; Qual</b>: The change in quality given the conditioned
        cards are available.
    </ul>
