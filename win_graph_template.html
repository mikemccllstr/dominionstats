      <h3>Understanding the graph</h3>
      <h4>Win rates</h4>
      <p>
      Win rate is a generalization of winning probability for multiplayer 
      games.
      <p>A win in a 2 player game is worth 2 points, a 3 player game
      is worth 3, and so on.  Someone who plays only 2 player games and 
      wins every time will have a winrate of 2; a 2-player gamer who loses
      every game has a winrate of 0; a 2-player gamer who wins exactly as 
      often as expected (half wins, half losses) has a winrate of 1.
      <p>The win rate of an event is the average
      number of points for that event.  So an event that is uncorrelated
      with winning will have a win rate of 1.0, and events correlated with
      winning have a win rate of &gt; 1.0, and losing with &lt; 1.0.

      <h4>Error bars</h4>
      <p>The error bars represent a 95% confidence interval in the measure for a 
	particular event.

      <p>The smaller the bars, the more times a particular event was observed, and
      hence the less likely the true value is signficantly away from the center
      point due to randomness.
      
      <p>The error bars represent Â±2 standard deviations.  They encode the true
      mean for any particular point with a probability of about 95%.  

      <h4>Correlation</h4>
        Don't get too carried away with interpreting these graphs: 
        <a href="http://xkcd.com/552/">correlation does not imply 
	causation</a>.  
      <ul>
	<li>In general, cards with high costs tend to look good, because they
	  are correlated with their buyer having lots of money.  Someone who is able to get to
    $8 is naturally going to have a higher win rate than someone who is only able to get to $6. 
	<li>Similarly, Duchies are often bought in the late game by players who are behind and 
   unwilling to end the game by buying out the Provinces.
	<li>In addition, the 'card advantage' graph
	  is most accurate for non-terminal cards and cards that you 
	  typically want more than one copy of.  For instance, it buckets the [2 Chapels vs 1 Chapel]
     situation into the same event as [1 Chapel vs 0 Chapels].  This is why, on average,
     the graph displays a 1-Chapel advantage has being correlated with a below-average winrate
      </ul>

      <h4>The best choice</h4>
      <p>Note that these statistics are merely an average over many games.  They do not
      necessarily say much about any particular game.  So even though 
      one card's early winning rate may be higher than a different card's winning
      rate on the same turn, it does not follow that the more winning card
      is neccesarily the best choice for any particular game.
     
      <h4>Curses and Embargo</h4>
      <p>The apparent weirdness with the Curse graph is due to the fact that
	Curses are rarely intentionally gained.  The only exceptions are when
   players are ending the game (almost always in a winning position) by running out
   the Curse pile, or are gaining Curses as a side effect of Embargo tokens.  When people
	buy things despite being Embargoed, they are often buying a very valuable card.
